    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
            I have had an interest in Computer Science since high school; but it was not until college that I was able to fully explore this interest.
            During my time at the University of Arkansas, I have taken various coursework that have allowed me to become proficient in coding languages such as Python, Java, C++, SQL
            and HTML. I have various projects that showcase my knowledge. I was fortunate enough to get an internship where I worked as Data Analyst Intern and was able to apply my SQL knowledge as well as improve on it. I will be graduating 
            with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Math in Spring 2025.

                This was a group project done under the McMillion Innovation Studio at the University of Arkansas. This project aimed to solve an issue with communication between hospitals in the Northwest Arkansas (NWA) area. 
                As doctors diagnose their patients, they may come to the conclusion that their patient requires psychiatric care; however their facility may not offer that. This means they must find a different facility with available 
                beds for their patient. Unfortunately, this is a tedious process that requires many phone calls and hours. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The goal of this project was to create a website that would allow the hospitals in the NWA area to easily find available psychiatric beds for their patients.
                Utilizing HTML, Python, and NoSQL, I mainly worked on developing the front end of the website while assisting with the back end development as needed. Eventually I was promoted to product manager, 
                which meant in addition to developing, I was leading the team and communicating with potential consumers for feedback and making improvements as necessary.

                This was a project done with a group of peers as a capstone project.
                <br>
                <br>
                SLS Community is a local organization that provides care for neurodivergent adults. At SLS Community, they utilize an ABC (Antecedent – Behavior – Consequence) form to provide behavior support to their community members. 
                This form works by allowing staff to mark the different behaviors that the community member has displayed as well as what led up to the behavior and what happened afterwards.
                The objective of this project was to create an application that will allow SLS Community to better create, save, and review their ABC forms. 
                <br>
                <br>
                With the use of Flutter, Google Firebase, and Firestore we created a website that possesses the capability to collect ABC (Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence) data and store it in a secure and efficient manner. 
                The users have the ability to view, add, and download ABC forms.
